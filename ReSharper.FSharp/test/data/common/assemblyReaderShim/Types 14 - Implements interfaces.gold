(0): ReSharper Warning: It is recommended that objects supporting the IDisposable interface are created using the syntax 'new Type(args)', rather than 'Type(args)' or 'Type' as a function value representing the constructor, to indicate that resources may be owned by the generated value
(1): ReSharper Underlined Error Highlighting: Type constraint mismatch. The type 
    'Foo'    
is not compatible with type
    'IComparable'
